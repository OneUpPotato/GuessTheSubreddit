            2. Don't ruin it by cheating.

            3. Please report broken posts.

            # How does this subreddit work?

            1. A post is made by the bot every 30 minutes.

            3. The post is left open for 6 hours to allow people to try and guess what subreddit that post has come from..

            4. After 6 hours, the post will be locked and points will be awarded to the users who guessed correctly.

            We currently suggest that you sort by new when looking for posts.
